It is a mini project for Spiro-mask
<br>
I started with recording the breathing first as given and it's length is around of 7minutes .After that the task asks us to answer 3 question :- 
<br>
Question 1 : What is the sampling rate of recorded audio file?
<br>
answer : For this ,I simply download a tool named" MediaTab" which essentially gives us so much information after right clicking and selecting properties of a particular file. I have attached the exact screenshot of it . For my audio file the sampling rate is found out to be 48.0KHz.

Question 2 : To filter out higher frequencies 
<br>
Answer : For this ,  I downloaded a free software named "Audacity" . Through which I first uploaded my original audio file and then simply applied the "Low pass Filter" , which essentially acts as threshold frequency such that it removes frequencies which are above the threshold frequency which is preset by the user . It only passes the frequency which are below threshold frequency and that is why it is called a low pass filter. For this mini project  I saved 2 files after applying this at 600Hz and 700Hz as threshold frequency. I have also attached all these files as well in google form.

Question 3 In what frequency range is the breathing information is present?
<br>
Answer : I tried to analyze this problem by various methods. I plot 3 graphs of frequency analysis in audacity software itself. First graph is of original recording, Second and third graph are after applying low pass filter at 600Hz and 700Hz respectively. I found out graphs for 600hz and 700hz do not have a significant difference , which I think it could mean that breathing frequency could lie upto 600-700 hz. Also one interesting observation I found out that generally frequency is lower while inhaling than frequency while exhaling . I have attached all 3 graphs also.
